Over/Under

The most common type of over/under bet is placed on the combined score of the two teams playing in the game.
The concept of betting on totals, or better known as over/under, in NFL betting comprises of wagers being placed on whether the total amount of points scored within a game will be higher or lower than a pre-determined number set by the corresponding sportsbook being used. Similarly to the spread, the Over/Under can aid in predicting the outcome of a game. 
In the event that a game exceeds regular game time play, overtime will be included. If the outcome of the total points for the game falls exactly on the quotted line/pre-determined value, the total is then declared as a "push", in which all wagers are returned to the bettors.
