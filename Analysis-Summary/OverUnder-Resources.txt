Intial Process

Researching and collecting datasets online to form csv files to be extract data for NFL Teams, scoring history, stadium locations and betting history. Once the csv files were located, cleaning the data on python into one dataframe for all the objectives covered in the assignment.

======================================

Over/Under

The most common type of over/under bet is placed on the combined score of the two teams playing in the game.
The concept of betting on totals, or better known as over/under, in NFL betting comprises of wagers being placed on whether the total amount of points scored within a game will be higher or lower than a pre-determined number set by the corresponding sportsbook being used. Similarly to the spread, the Over/Under can aid in predicting the outcome of a game. 
In the event that a game exceeds regular game time play, overtime will be included. If the outcome of the total points for the game falls exactly on the quotted line/pre-determined value, the total is then declared as a "push", in which all wagers are returned to the bettors.

Over/Under Ratio by Season

From the original dataframe created, I filtered the data into a new dataframe only consisiting of the columns needed for my analysis. Once I had narrowed down the columns I needed, I then created a column that would calculate the total score of each game that was played. I then was able to determine the status of whether that game was higher or lower than the pre-determined value from the over under line.
Once that information was filtered, I created a bar chart to showcase the total games that had fallen over or under for each NFL Season from 2013 to 2022.

====================================

Over/Under Ratio per Team

There are currently 32 Teams in the NFL. After filtering through the data and creating a bar chart, there were a few NFL Teams that stood out. For example, Kansas City Chiefs
