 ## Slide #1
 TITLE --> Analyis - How is NFL betting affected by the type of stadium the games are played in ?
* Stadium Types are either Indoors (dome stadium) or Outdoors (open-air stadium)
* Question 1) - Is stadium type, being either indoor or outdoor factored in when the over/under line is set for games ? 
* Question 2) - Is there a homefield advantage to teams playing their home games indoors versus outdoors ?

Slide #2 
TITLE --> Over/Under Line by Stadium Type
IMAGES --> 1)overunderdf.png, 2)overunder_by_stadium.png, 3)t-test_results.png
* Alternate Hypothesis: If stadium type is factored into how the over/under lines are set. Then the average over/under line for games played indoors should be higher than the games played outdoors. 
Null Hypothesis: If stadium is NOT factored into how the over/under lines are set. Then the average over/under line for games played indoor will NOT be higher than the games played outdoors.
IF SLIDE TOO BUSY EXCLUDE NULL HYPOTHESIS



Slide #3 
TITLE --> Home Field Advantage Analysis
IMAGES --> 1)%homegameswon.png, 2)homegames_by_stadiumtype.png
* Only 10 of 32 NFL teams have Indoor home fields
* 1983 of the 2707 games played since 2013 occured outdoors
* No real advantage to either home stadium type
* More correlation to a slight home field advantage in general
